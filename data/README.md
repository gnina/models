# This section of the repository contains the data used for training and evaluating models with GNINA

## Breakdown of sub-directories
 * CrossDocked2020  -- Curated data from Pocketome. The molecules with >1000Da molecular weight were excluded.
                             Contains the UFF minimized data, as well as docked poses generated by smina, and an iterative docking procedure.
 * PDBBind2016      -- Curated data from the PDBBind. Included is the General, Refined, and Core sets, filtered for molecules with <1000Da molecular weight.
                            Contains the crystal data, as well as docked poses generated by smina.
 * csar             -- CSAR data used in [Protein-Ligand Scoring with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00740)
 * general          -- Types files for the PDBbind used in [Protein-Ligand Scoring with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00740)
 * refined          -- Many types files used to train models in [Protein-Ligand Scoring with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00740)
